# GqTwitterFollowers
Organize your followers and friends

This is the first alpha Twitter Followers upload. This web application allows you to organize your twitter followers and friends. You can mostly work off-line. Only when you click on 'Get data from Twitter' it will either get your friends or followers from twitter.

Offline you can then organize your twitter followers and friends. You can follow followers that you don't follow and unfollow friends who do not follow you, either by selecting specific users or all. You can also followers to a 'do not unfollow' list so you do not 'unfollow' those you really do not want to 'unfollow'. The same you can do with people you never ever want to start following.


To allow you to start you must create a twitter app with your Twitter account at 'https://apps.twitter.com/'

and create your security keys and tokens.

These must be added to the app settings in the web config file:

Once you have set these values you should be up and running.

Please note that the Horizontal MenuBar used in this app can be found at: https://gqmenubar.codeplex.com/
